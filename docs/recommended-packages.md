## General

### System information tools (aka. fetch scripts)

NOTE: This tool is useful for screenshots.

`Neofetch` was discontinued at 2 August 2020. Also seems the same happened for `screenFetch`.

For me, [Fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) is the best alternative.

Other alternatives:
- [Archey](https://github.com/HorlogeSkynet/archey4)
- [NerdFetch](https://github.com/ThatOneCalculator/NerdFetch)
- [macchina](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina)
